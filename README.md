# Java Console-Based Online Quiz App

A simple **Command-Line Interface (CLI) application** to conduct a **Java quiz**. The application allows users to **answer multiple-choice questions** and **see their score** at the end.

---

## Objective
To create a Java program that allows users to **attempt a quiz via the console**. The project introduces **object-oriented concepts**, **control flow**, and **logic implementation** in Java, providing hands-on experience with classes, lists, and conditional statements.

---

## Features
- **Java Quiz Questions** – Includes multiple-choice questions related to Java fundamentals.  
- **Interactive CLI** – Prompts users to select answers using numeric input.  
- **Score Calculation** – Tracks the number of correct answers and displays the final score.  
- **Immediate Feedback** – Informs the user if their answer is correct or wrong.  
- **Expandable Questions** – New questions can be added easily to the quiz list.  
- **Object-Oriented Design** – Uses a `Question` class to encapsulate question data and behavior.

---

## Implementation Details
- **Question Class** – Represents each quiz question with text, options, and the correct answer index.  
- **List of Questions** – Stores all quiz questions using `ArrayList<Question>`.  
- **Scanner** – Accepts user input from the console.  
- **checkAnswer Method** – Compares user input with the stored correct answer.  
- **Looping Logic** – Iterates through each question, displays it, collects answers, and updates the score.  
- **Score Display** – Shows the total correct answers and the total number of questions at the end of the quiz.

## Conclusion
This project provides a practical example of **Java programming with CLI interaction**. It demonstrates how to use **classes, lists, loops, and conditional statements** to implement real-world functionality. Users gain experience in **object-oriented design**, **logic implementation**, and **basic user interaction** in Java.
